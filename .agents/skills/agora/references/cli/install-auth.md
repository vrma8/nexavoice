# Agora CLI Install and Auth

<!-- applies-from: v0.2.1 -->

Use this file when the user needs to install the Agora CLI, authenticate, or verify that the local install is healthy.

Last verified against Agora CLI `0.2.7`. Minimum CLI `0.2.1`.

> **Agents:** start with the read-only **CLI readiness** probe in [README.md](README.md). Installers are allowed only as readiness remediation after user approval. That section is the single source of truth for version gates, curl-first upgrade, PATH recovery, and config mismatch errors.

## Install

Ask for user approval before running installers, shell-profile updates, or package removal commands.

## Version Gate and Upgrade

Use [README.md](README.md#cli-readiness-agents) as the canonical agent readiness flow.

- Read-only probe first: `agora version` and `which -a agora` / `where.exe agora`.
- If `agora` is missing or below Minimum CLI `0.2.1`, stop normal CLI workflow and upgrade.
- Preferred remediation after approval: `curl -fsSL https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.sh | sh`.
- If `agora version` still reports an old version after install, check PATH shadowing with `which -a agora` / `where.exe agora` and follow `agora doctor`'s shell-specific PATH fix. Do not uninstall automatically; remove an old binary only after user approval, using `install.sh --uninstall` / `install.ps1 -Uninstall` for installer-managed installs.
- If the CLI errors with `Config version N is newer than this CLI supports`, an old binary is reading config written by a newer CLI. Upgrade through the readiness flow; edit config only as a last resort after backing it up.

Preferred macOS / Linux / POSIX shell installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell installer:

```powershell
irm https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.ps1 | iex
```

### npm-managed installs

<!-- npm agoraio-cli is deliberately omitted as an install path. Latest published is
     0.1.6 (below Minimum CLI) and publishing is disabled upstream (commit aad8582).
     Upstream docs/install.md still lists npm as "Available" — do not restore it from
     there. Restore only if npm publishing resumes AND the published version clears
     the floor. -->

npm `agoraio-cli` is **not** a current install path. Never recommend it for install or upgrade.

Surface the migration below **only when detection shows an npm-managed install** — the readiness gate already runs `which -a agora`; if the resolved binary sits under `npm prefix -g`, it is npm-managed. If npm is not installed on the machine, the install cannot be npm-managed — skip this check. Otherwise this section does not apply and should not be mentioned.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.sh | sh -s -- --replace-npm
```

Windows PowerShell (there is no `-ReplaceNpm` flag):

```powershell
npm uninstall -g agoraio-cli
irm https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.ps1 | iex
```

Two traps to avoid:

- `install.ps1` refuses to overwrite an npm-managed install and exits `7`, printing `npm update -g agoraio-cli` as the remedy. Do **not** follow it — that resolves to `0.1.6`, below Minimum CLI.
- Do **not** pass `-Force` to bypass the exit-`7` refusal. It creates a side-by-side install and the PATH shadowing the readiness gate then has to untangle.

The shell installers add the binary directory to `PATH` and wire shell completion by default. Use `--no-path`, `--no-completion`, or `--skip-shell` only when the user explicitly wants to opt out.

The installed command is:

```bash
agora --help
agora version
agora doctor --json
```

If the user still has the deprecated preview package:

```bash
npm uninstall -g agora-cli-preview
curl -fsSL https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.sh | sh
```

For pinned versions, uninstall, custom install directories, Windows details, or source builds, use the upstream install docs in <https://github.com/AgoraIO/cli>.

> ⚠️ Removed in v0.2.0: the `--add-to-path` installer flag. Use `curl -fsSL https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.sh | sh` instead; PATH wiring is on by default.

## Login Flow

Primary commands:

```bash
agora login
agora login --no-browser
agora whoami
agora logout
```

Equivalent auth-group commands:

```bash
agora auth login
agora auth status
agora auth status --json
agora auth logout
```

`agora login` starts an OAuth browser flow and stores a local session.

If browser auto-open fails, use `agora login --no-browser` so the CLI prints a URL and the user can open it manually.

### Region — determine, do not ask

`agora login` without `--region` sets the active region to `global` and discards the previous project context. Resolve the region from state:

1. If `.agora/project.json` records a **non-empty** `region`, pass it: `agora login --region <region>`. An empty `region` value means "no opinion" — do not pass `--region ""`; the flag only accepts `global` or `cn` and rejects an empty string.
2. Otherwise, if a prior session recorded `data.region` via `agora auth status --json`, preserve it by passing that value the same way: `agora login --region <region>`
3. Otherwise run bare `agora login` — `global` is correct for the large majority

Never prompt the user to choose a region. If the CLI returns `PROJECT_REGION_MISMATCH`, its error names both regions and the exact command to run — follow that.

For agents, use `agora auth status --json`. Unauthenticated status is still a recoverable auth state; the JSON error envelope uses exit code `3` with `AUTH_UNAUTHENTICATED`.

## Verification and Failure Modes

Run the install self-test before debugging higher-level project issues:

```bash
agora doctor
agora doctor --json
```

Observed exit codes:

- `0`: healthy install
- `1`: blocking install issues
- `2`: warnings
- `3`: auth or session issues

Common failures:

- If `agora doctor` reports PATH issues, follow the command it prints for the current shell.
- If `agora doctor` reports DNS or network failures, fix network or proxy settings before retrying `agora login`.
- If `agora login` is run in JSON, CI, or non-TTY mode without an existing session, `-y` / `--yes` does not start a new browser flow; the command fails fast with `AUTH_UNAUTHENTICATED`.

## OAuth Loopback Rule

The loopback login flow advertises a redirect URI shaped like:

```text
http://localhost:<port>/oauth/callback
```

Important rule:

- the `redirect_uri` sent to authorize and token exchange must match exactly
- treat `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as different strings for OAuth validation

If the user reports a `redirect_uri mismatch` or a browser login that gets a `400` during token exchange, tell them to check for any local tooling or overrides that switch one step to `127.0.0.1` while the other still uses `localhost`.

## Config and Session Location

The CLI stores config, session, logs, and current-project context under the Agora CLI config directory.

- macOS default: `~/.agora-cli`
- Linux default: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agora-cli` or `~/.config/agora-cli`
- local override for testing or isolation: `AGORA_HOME=/custom/path`

## What to Tell the User

- If they are not logged in, tell them to run `agora login` first.
- If they ask "am I logged in?", use `agora whoami`, `agora whoami --plain`, or `agora auth status --json`.
- If they ask which environment overrides exist, use `agora env-help --json`.
- If they want a noninteractive or isolated local setup, route to [automation.md](automation.md).

## Things Not to Overstate

- Do not promise headless service-account auth; the verified flow is browser-based OAuth.
- Do not document `--add-to-path`; it was removed in `0.2.0`.
- Do not claim the preview package is still the recommended install target.
- Use `agora` for an installed CLI. Use `./agora` only when running a local binary built from the CLI repository.
- Do not present npm `agoraio-cli` as an install or upgrade channel.
- Do not ask the user which region they want; resolve it from state.
