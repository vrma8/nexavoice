# Conversational AI Quickstart

Use this file for `quickstart` and `integration` mode from [README.md](README.md).

## Working-Baseline Rule

A **working ConvoAI baseline** means the developer has already started an Agora ConvoAI agent successfully and the client can join the same RTC channel and interact with it.

The following do **not** count as a working baseline:

- only RTC code exists
- a sample repo is cloned but the agent has never started successfully
- environment variables are present but unverified
- the user only knows the desired backend language or framework

If the user already has a working baseline, exit this file and route back through [README.md](README.md).

## Quickstart Source and Runtime Proof

### Official repo (Path A)

For this flow, pick the correct official template by stack:

- Python baseline (`agent-quickstart-python`) with Bun, using
  `https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-python`
- Next.js baseline (`agent-quickstart-nextjs`) with pnpm, using
  `https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-nextjs`
- Go baseline (`agent-quickstart-go`) with Makefile-based startup, using the official Go quickstart template for the `go` template family in Agora CLI.

Use this official sample as-is and only adapt documented fields once clone + runtime checks pass.

### Required env mapping by template

Use template-specific env files/keys for the selected official template:

- Next.js quickstart (`agent-quickstart-nextjs`):
  - write `.env.local`
  - `AGORA_APP_ID` -> `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID`
  - `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` -> `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`
- Python quickstart (`agent-quickstart-python`):
  - write `server/.env`
  - `AGORA_APP_ID` -> `APP_ID`
  - `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` -> `APP_CERTIFICATE`
- Go quickstart (`agent-quickstart-go`):
  - write `server-go/.env`
  - `AGORA_APP_ID` -> `APP_ID`
  - `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` -> `APP_CERTIFICATE`

The quickstart is the source of truth for code shape. The agent does not need to prove Agora's official quickstart works in the abstract before reading or adapting it. It does need runtime proof before claiming the user's environment, Agora project, and customized flow work end to end.

Track runtime proof with this artifact:

```yaml
baseline_gate:
  quickstart_repo_cloned: false # official sample cloned at a known path
  official_start_command_run: false # documented start command run verbatim
  agent_join_verified: false # agent reached RUNNING in the RTC channel
  rtc_client_connected: false # client joined the same channel and heard agent audio
```

If `quickstart_repo_cloned` is false, the following are blocked:

- `/join` payload generation from memory
- SDK implementation files in the user's repo
- custom file structures or new app scaffolds
- existing-app edits that are not backed by a copy map sourced from the official quickstart

After the official quickstart source is cloned and inspected, the agent may:

- update the cloned quickstart's agent prompt, greeting, persona, scenario details, or documented join/config fields to match the user's requested agent
- produce a copy map for an existing app from the inspected quickstart files
- adapt only the mapped quickstart-derived pieces into the user's app after copy-map approval

Do not change the sample's architecture, token flow, env names, lifecycle, or documented commands unless the official quickstart source itself requires a minimal upstream-shaped fix.

The baseline gate is complete only when the sample-ready gate succeeds: app opens, conversation starts, the agent joins the RTC channel, and the user can speak and hear TTS back.

## Response Status Rules

Before every actionable reply, reconcile the current `baseline_gate` state with the action you are about to take. This internal check is mandatory but is not user-visible by default.

Show status only in these cases:

| Trigger                               | Format      | Fields                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First ConvoAI reply                   | Full block  | `official_template`, `next_command`, `baseline_gate`, `blocked` |
| Gate flips from false to true         | One line    | `baseline_gate: 2/4 -> 3/4; next: <command>`                    |
| Blocked action                        | Short block | False gate field plus the command that unblocks it              |
| User asks "where are we?" or "status" | Full block  | Same as first-reply format                                      |
| Routine command, Q&A, explanation     | No footer   | None                                                            |

Use checkmark glyphs in user-visible baseline status:

```text
baseline_gate:
  ✓ quickstart_repo_cloned
  ✗ official_start_command_run
  ✗ agent_join_verified
  ✗ rtc_client_connected
```

Tone rules:

- Do not use the phrase "policy violation" in user-visible replies. Say what is blocked and what command unblocks it.
- Do not use "Track A" or "Track B" in user-visible replies. Say "baseline" and "integration."
- Keep the footer silent on routine progress; show it only when it changes something for the user.

## Recovery Rule

If the agent has already deviated, stop the custom path and pivot back to the official sample.

Deviation triggers:

- generated a `/join` payload from memory before inspecting quickstart source
- created SDK implementation files in the user's repo before inspecting quickstart source and producing a copy map
- created a new `package.json`, `routes/`, or scaffold for a ConvoAI app instead of adapting the official quickstart source
- changed documented sample command semantics, such as replacing the README start command with a custom wrapper
- attempted to fix `[ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS]` or configure pnpm build approvals instead of proceeding to the documented start command
- wrote `.env` / `.env.local` with literal `$AGORA_APP_ID` or `$AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` strings instead of expanded credential values

Recovery response:

1. Acknowledge the deviation in plain language.
2. Show the current `baseline_gate` with incomplete fields.
3. Give the exact next official sample command.
4. Do not continue custom edits until source alignment is restored. Runtime proof is still required before claiming the flow works.

## Sequence

Follow this exact user-visible order:

1. Product intro in plain language
2. Intake — confirm preferred stack (`python` or `node/ts`) and confirm whether the agent is allowed to install/upgrade missing tools
3. Environment check — verify runtime dependencies are installed
4. Project-readiness checkpoint — use the CLI directly to verify and fix
5. Vendor-path confirmation — **skip if the user has not mentioned BYOK, providers, or Studio Agent ID; defaults apply automatically**
6. Vendor selection, only if the user asks for the current provider list or chooses a non-default path
7. Studio Agent ID confirmation, only if the user wants to reuse an agent configured in Agora Studio
8. Structured quickstart spec

## Interaction Rules

- One decision group per turn. Do not ask credentials and vendor path in the same reply.
- Skip anything the user already answered.
- Resolve required values in this order: session memory, read-only workspace detection, then one focused question. Explicit user statements win over detected values, and the latest user statement wins on conflict. Do not re-ask for values the user already provided.
- **Auto-skip `vendor_defaults`**: if the user has not mentioned BYOK, vendor API keys, a specific provider, or a Studio Agent ID, skip the vendor gate entirely and use the defaults. Do not ask about providers when the user just wants the fastest path.
- Infer obvious context from the user's stack or repository description.
- Mirror the user's language.
- While quickstart source is unresolved, do **not** generate `/join` payloads, SDK code, custom file structures, clone commands, or repo adaptation plans from memory.
- While quickstart is unresolved, read only this file and [README.md](README.md).
- If the user asks to use the CLI to speed up onboarding, keep the request inside this quickstart flow. The CLI is already the default readiness path, so continue normally.
- Unless the user explicitly asks for BYOK (bring your own key) or a different provider stack, anchor on the defaults first — no vendor API keys needed.
- For non-default provider selection, fetch the official current provider docs before confirming support or generating config details.
- If the user already has an **Agora Studio Agent ID** from `https://console.agora.io/studio/agents`, treat that as a separate quickstart branch. Do not re-ask STT/LLM/TTS provider choices unless the user explicitly wants to replace the Studio-managed config.
- If stack preference is unknown, ask one short intake question before selecting the baseline sample.
- If stack preference is still unspecified after intake, default to `agent-quickstart-python`.
- When starting from scratch, customize the cloned quickstart's agent prompt, greeting, persona, scenario details, or documented join/config fields to match the user's requested agent. Keep architecture, env names, token flow, lifecycle, and documented commands intact.

## Industry-Standard Execution Policy

Apply this policy for quickstart setup actions:

1. Detect first: run read-only checks and report what is installed.
2. Recommend second: propose the best baseline path from user preference + detected tools.
3. Confirm scope before mutate: ask once for bounded quickstart setup approval.
4. Execute exactly: once confirmed, run the documented command without substituting variants.
5. Report clearly: summarize what changed and what remains blocked.

Guardrails:

- Never silently install or upgrade system tools.
- Never assume language/runtime preference when the user has already stated one.
- Prefer least-surprise behavior: explicit approval for machine changes, deterministic commands, and transparent outcomes.

Approved quickstart setup scope covers:

- installing or upgrading missing non-system setup tools needed for the selected baseline (`bun`, `pnpm`/`npm`, `agora`)
- running `agora login`
- selecting an existing suitable project
- enabling required Agora features on the selected project
- writing or updating the selected sample's expected env file
- updating the selected sample's documented agent prompt, greeting, persona, scenario details, or join/config fields requested by the user
- installing the selected sample's dependencies
- starting the selected sample

Ask again before:

- creating a new Agora project
- deleting files, uninstalling packages, or removing projects
- overwriting env files with `--overwrite`
- printing or exposing secrets in chat
- installing or upgrading system runtimes such as Node.js or Python
- changing files or settings outside the selected quickstart repo and selected Agora project

## Known Non-Blocking Warnings

Exit code alone does not determine whether to proceed. Read command output and match it against known non-blocking patterns before treating a non-zero exit as failure requiring remediation.

### Node/TS baseline (`agent-quickstart-nextjs`)

After `pnpm install` reports `[ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS]`:

- Run the documented `pnpm dev` once. The warning is non-blocking only if that command starts Next.js and a real GET of the local URL returns a non-empty successful response.
- If `pnpm dev` exits before Next.js starts with the same ignored-builds error, use the sample's npm scripts without changing the quickstart's tracked configuration: `npm install --package-lock=false`, then `npm run dev`.
- If pnpm is not installed, do not invoke it through `npx` or another wrapper; use the documented npm fallback directly when the sample supports npm.
- Do not run `pnpm approve-builds`, set pnpm build-approval configuration, add pnpm configuration to `package.json`, or create `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `pnpm.yaml`.

## Command Integrity Under Environment Restrictions

For the first-success gate, treat the sample README commands as exact.

If a documented command fails because of sandbox, permission, port-binding, filesystem, or network restrictions:

1. Do **not** replace the command with an equivalent variant.
2. Do **not** add flags, env vars, host overrides, alternate entrypoints, or custom wrappers.
3. Re-run the exact documented command with required escalation or approval if available.
4. If escalation is unavailable or denied, stop and report that the baseline is blocked by the execution environment, not by the sample itself.
5. Do **not** continue to customization until the sample has been validated with the documented command.

Forbidden substitutions include:

- `pnpm dev` → `pnpm exec next dev ...`
- `npm run dev` → `next dev ...`
- README clone/start commands → custom shell variants that change the command semantics

## Failure Attribution

If the documented sample command fails before app code runs and the error indicates a local execution restriction, classify it as an environment constraint.

Typical signals include:

- `EPERM`
- `EACCES`
- blocked `listen` / `bind`
- blocked `chmod` / filesystem permission errors
- sandbox-denied network or local resource access

Do **not** reinterpret these failures as sample misconfiguration and do **not** change the command to work around them.

### Install warnings (Node/TS baseline)

When `pnpm install` exits non-zero only for `[ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS]`, packages may still be linked but required lifecycle scripts have not run. Start with `pnpm dev` and verify the page with a real GET. If that command exits before Next.js starts for the same reason, use the npm fallback above. Do not describe the sample as ready until the page is actually reachable.

## First-Success Readiness Layers

Use three readiness layers during quickstart:

- **Control-plane ready** — login works, the project resolves, App ID exists, App Certificate can be exported through the verified CLI surface, required features are enabled, and `agora project doctor` is not blocking.
- **Runtime ready** — services are actually usable. In practice, RTM enablement may lag behind control-plane state; after enablement, allow bounded wait/retry for up to about 5 minutes before deciding the project still needs intervention.
- **Sample ready** — the official sample installs, env is populated, the app starts, the browser can open, the user can press `Try it now`, the agent joins the RTC channel, and the frontend does not crash.

`agora project doctor` only proves **control-plane ready**. It does not prove runtime or sample readiness.

## CLI-Driven Readiness Check

The project readiness step requires the agent to directly execute Agora CLI commands to verify and fix prerequisites. Do not ask the user to run CLI commands themselves and do not offer manual alternatives. The agent checks directly; mutating actions may proceed inside the approved quickstart setup scope.

The CLI covers:

- login / auth status
- current project selection
- project env export
- official quickstart cloning and repo-local binding
- template-aware quickstart env writing
- feature enablement
- App ID presence, App Certificate presence, and other basic project checks
- `agora project doctor` readiness checks

Use the CLI in this order:

1. For a new official quickstart, prefer `agora init` when it can clone, bind the project, and write env safely.
2. For an existing official quickstart, use `agora quickstart env write` to seed env files.
3. Use `agora project env --with-secrets --json` only for manual mapping flows that need raw credential values.
4. Use `project show --json` only for project metadata inspection.

For CI or source-only setup without an Agora login session, use
`agora quickstart create <name> --template <template>` without `--project`.
That clones the official template and intentionally skips remote project
resolution and CLI env seeding. Configure the template's expected env file in a
separate action using CI-provided credentials, then verify it separately.

Keep credential-file writes as a standalone setup action, followed by a separate
verification action. Do not combine env-file creation, secret expansion, and
dependency installation into one opaque shell command; this keeps setup
auditable and makes failures attributable to the correct step.

When `AGORA_APP_ID` and `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` are already available in the
environment, that does not bypass the CLI path: after CLI readiness, run
`agora quickstart env write <repo> --project <project>` as its own command and
then inspect the generated file in a separate command. Only use a manual mapping
when the CLI cannot perform the selected template-aware write, and keep each
file-write and verification action separate.

Do **not** treat a healthy doctor result as a proven ConvoAI baseline.

For command details, route to the CLI references:

- [../cli/README.md](../cli/README.md)
- [../cli/quickstarts.md](../cli/quickstarts.md)
- [../cli/env.md](../cli/env.md)
- [../cli/projects.md](../cli/projects.md)
- [../cli/doctor.md](../cli/doctor.md)

After the CLI readiness step is resolved, return to this quickstart and continue from the same readiness checkpoint.

## First-Success Baseline Selection

Select the baseline sample from user preference first, then installed tools:

- If user explicitly wants Python (or has no preference): use `agent-quickstart-python`.
- If user explicitly wants Node/TypeScript and has Node 22+ plus pnpm 8+ (preferred) or npm fallback: use `agent-quickstart-nextjs`.
- If user asks for Go as the final backend, still complete one official quickstart baseline first, then route to [go-sdk.md](go-sdk.md) for backend implementation.

If no stack preference is provided, default to:

- **Repo:** <https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-python> _(Python server + React frontend)_

1. Runtime prerequisites
   1.1 Python baseline: Bun (package manager & script runner) + Python 3.8+
   1.2 Node/TS baseline: Node.js 22+ + pnpm 8+ preferred; fallback to npm when pnpm is unavailable and the sample supports npm
2. CLI preflight
   2.1 Complete [CLI readiness](../cli/README.md#cli-readiness-agents) — block if below Minimum CLI `0.2.1` or PATH resolves an old binary
   2.2 Log in: `agora login`
   2.3 Verify CLI version with `agora version` (Minimum CLI `0.2.1`)
   2.4 Prefer `agora init <name> --template <template> --json` where `<template>` matches the selected baseline (`python` or `nextjs`)
   2.5 For an existing official quickstart, use `agora quickstart env write <repo> --project <project>` — not `project env write`
   2.6 If decomposing the flow, prefer the current selected project only if it is directly usable for first-success
   2.7 Otherwise select another directly usable project, or ask before creating a new dedicated token-ready project
   2.8 Ensure `rtc`, `rtm`, and `convoai` are enabled for the first-success path
   2.9 Use `agora project env --with-secrets --json` only when direct raw credential values are explicitly needed outside `init` / `quickstart env write`
   2.10 Check `agora project doctor`
   2.11 If RTM was just enabled, allow bounded wait/retry before concluding runtime failure
3. Official sample baseline
   3.1 Clone the selected official quickstart (`agent-quickstart-python`, `agent-quickstart-nextjs`, or `agent-quickstart-go`) directly or through `agora init`
   3.2 Install and start with the selected sample's documented commands:
   - Python baseline: `bun install` then `bun run dev`
   - Node/TS baseline: run `pnpm install` then `pnpm dev` when pnpm is available; otherwise run the documented `npm install --package-lock=false` then `npm run dev` fallback when the sample supports npm. Never substitute `npx pnpm`, `pnpm exec`, or a direct framework command.
   3.3 Ensure the expected env file is present:
   - Python baseline: `server/.env` with `APP_ID` + `APP_CERTIFICATE`
   - Node/TS baseline: `.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` + `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`
   - Go baseline: `server-go/.env` with `APP_ID` + `APP_CERTIFICATE`
     (`agora quickstart env write` is the default seeding path)
     3.4 Do not rename the sample's env variables during first success
4. Success gate
   4.1 App loads at the sample's documented local URL
   4.2 User can start a conversation from the UI
   4.3 Agent joins the RTC channel
   4.4 User can speak to the agent and hear TTS back
   4.5 Only after this counts as a working baseline

## First-Success Vendor Defaults

The official `agent-quickstart-nextjs` sample works out of the box with just Agora credentials.
Vendor API calls (STT, LLM, TTS) go through Agora by default — no vendor API keys needed.

The default is a cascading STT → LLM → TTS pipeline. Its provider and model
values are versioned with the quickstart and can change independently of this
skill. After cloning, inspect the sample's checked-in config and env examples;
do not substitute cached model IDs from this reference.

BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) is supported but optional. The sample includes commented-out
BYOK blocks for Deepgram, OpenAI, and ElevenLabs. Users who want to use their own vendor
API keys can uncomment those blocks and provide them.

For BYOK provider families and MLLM support, fetch the current official provider
docs and cross-check the cloned sample's commented configuration blocks before
presenting choices or editing config.

Use this rule during quickstart:

- For the first end-to-end success path, prefer the **default pipeline** (no vendor keys).
- Only switch to BYOK during quickstart if the user explicitly asks for it or names a specific vendor key they want to use.
- Only switch away from the default cascading pipeline if the user explicitly asks for MLLM.
- For the current provider matrix or vendor-specific configs, fetch the official live docs before claiming support or listing parameters.

## Env Name Policy

### Default sample path (`agent-quickstart-python`)

Keep the official sample's env names as the source of truth.

Default (no vendor keys needed):

```bash
APP_ID=
APP_CERTIFICATE=
PORT=8000
```

Do **not** prompt for vendor API keys unless the user explicitly asks for BYOK.
Do **not** rename these env vars to a different custom scheme during quickstart.

### Custom-code path

If the user is no longer sample-aligned and needs provider-specific config layout, fetch the current official ConvoAI provider docs and use those as the source of truth.

## Agent Prompt and Join Details

When starting from scratch in an official quickstart, update the user-controlled agent details the user actually cares about before first run when they have provided them.

Allowed quickstart edits:

- agent/system prompt or instructions
- greeting or first message
- persona, role, language, tone, and scenario details
- documented agent name, channel naming, or join/config fields already present in the sample

Do not rewrite the join lifecycle, token generation, env loading, or provider schema by hand. If the requested change touches vendor-specific model/config fields not already clear in the sample, fetch the current official docs before editing those fields.

## Baseline Path

Default baseline is `agent-quickstart-python` unless the user explicitly chooses Node/TypeScript and the required Node plus package-manager runtime is available.

After first success, the user can explore other demos:

| Demo                      | Description                                     | Reference                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `agent-quickstart-nextjs` | Full-stack Next.js (single app with API routes) | [See below](#other-demo-references)  |
| `agent-samples`           | Decomposed backend + multiple client apps       | [agent-samples.md](agent-samples.md) |

## State Machine

The quickstart is a blocking state machine for source alignment and runtime proof. While a state is unresolved, the next action must stay inside the current gate. For integration mode, read-only workspace detection and quickstart source inspection are allowed when directed by [integration-from-quickstart.md](integration-from-quickstart.md).

| State               | Allowed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Forbidden                                           | Next prompt                | Advance when                                                                        |

### Pre-Action Self-Check

Before every tool call or user-visible reply:

1. What is the current state?
2. Is the intended action allowed in that state?
3. If not, send the state prompt instead.

### Failure Branches

- If the user says they cloned a repo but never got an agent running, stay in quickstart.
- If the user asks for code before quickstart resolves, answer with the next gate instead of generating code.
- If a reply only partially resolves the current gate, ask a narrow follow-up for the missing field only.
- If the user asks for the fastest onboarding path or mentions setup during the readiness gate, proceed directly with the CLI verification sequence and then return to the quickstart once readiness is confirmed.
- If the user asks for the full fastest onboarding flow and has not stated a stack preference, use `agent-quickstart-python`.
- If the user names a provider that is not in the current official provider docs, say this clearly: it is **not currently documented as supported in the official Agora ConvoAI provider docs**, so do not proceed as if it is supported. Offer the documented default combo or a live-doc verification path.
- If the user asks to see the provider list, fetch the current official provider docs and stay in the vendor gate until they accept the default combo or choose a documented alternative.
- If the user says they already have an Agora Studio Agent ID, switch to the `studio_agent_id` state and stop re-asking provider-vendor questions unless they explicitly say they want to replace the Studio-managed config.

## Prompt and Output Templates

When the state machine requires a user-facing prompt or the normalized output
spec, load [quickstart-prompts.md](quickstart-prompts.md). Keep execution and
safety decisions in this file; do not duplicate them in prompt text.

## Other Demo References

These are available after the first success baseline is proven. Do not use these as the default quickstart path.

### Full-Stack Next.js (`agent-quickstart-nextjs`)

**Repo:** <https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-nextjs>

Single Next.js app with built-in API routes for token generation and agent lifecycle. Includes React UI with live transcription. Use the runtime and package manager declared by the current repo, including a fallback only when its README documents one.

### Decomposed Samples (`agent-samples`)

Multiple backend + client combinations. See [agent-samples.md](agent-samples.md).

## After the Baseline Works

Once the first end-to-end ConvoAI session works, route by task:
