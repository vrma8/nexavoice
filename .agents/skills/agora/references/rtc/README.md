# Agora RTC (Video/Voice SDK)

Real-time audio and video communication. Users join channels, publish local tracks, and subscribe to remote tracks.

## Critical Rules

1. **Register event handlers BEFORE joining** the channel, or you will miss events for users already present.
2. **`user-published` fires separately** for audio and video. A user publishing both triggers two events — handle each.
3. **Track cleanup**: Always `stop()` then `close()` local tracks before setting to null. Failure to clean up causes memory leaks and device locks. (React SDK hooks handle this automatically — see `react.md`.)
4. **HTTPS required** for Web SDK (except `localhost`).
5. **Token management is mandatory in production**. Handle `token-privilege-will-expire` (Web) / `onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` (native) to renew tokens. UID in token must match UID used to join.
6. **Stream bombing prevention**: In production, generate tokens with subscriber role (`kRoleSubscriber` / `RtcRole.SUBSCRIBER`) for audience-only users to prevent unauthorized publishing.
7. **Audio autoplay (non-standard flows only)**: Browser autoplay policy is not an issue in typical RTC flows because the user has already clicked to join (satisfying the gesture requirement). However, if you auto-join on page load, trigger audio from a non-user event, or run in a headless/test environment, `audioTrack.play()` may be silently blocked. Wrap the join + publish sequence in a user gesture handler in these cases.

## Channel Profiles

- `rtc` (communication): All peers are equal. Best for video calls, conferencing.
- `live` (live streaming): Host/audience roles. Higher bitrate, lower latency for hosts.

## Video Encoder Profiles (Web)

```text
"120p_1"  → 160×120,   15fps, 65kbps
"180p_1"  → 320×180,   15fps, 140kbps
"360p_1"  → 640×360,   15fps, 400kbps
"480p_1"  → 640×480,   15fps, 500kbps
"720p_1"  → 1280×720,  15fps, 1130kbps
"720p_2"  → 1280×720,  30fps, 2000kbps
"1080p_1" → 1920×1080, 15fps, 2080kbps
"1080p_2" → 1920×1080, 30fps, 3000kbps
```

Or use custom config: `{ width: 640, height: 360, frameRate: 24, bitrateMin: 400, bitrateMax: 1000 }`

## Audio Encoder Profiles (Web)

```text
"speech_low_quality"      → mono, 16kHz, 24kbps
"speech_standard"         → mono, 32kHz, 24kbps
"high_quality"            → mono, 48kHz, 40kbps
"high_quality_stereo"     → stereo, 48kHz, 128kbps
```

## Dual Stream (Simulcast)

Send high+low quality streams simultaneously. Subscribers choose which to receive, enabling large-scale calls:

```javascript
// Web: Enable after joining
await client.enableDualStream();
client.setLowStreamParameter({
  width: 160,
  height: 90,
  framerate: 24,
  bitrate: 200,
});
// Switch remote user to low stream
client.setRemoteVideoStreamType(uid, 1); // 0=high, 1=low
```

## Screen Sharing (Web)

Use a separate client instance so screen publishing does not replace the camera
track. Read [screen-sharing.md](screen-sharing.md) for identity, token, system
audio, `track-ended`, and cleanup handling.

## Cross-Platform Interop Notes

When Web, iOS, and Android clients share the same channel:

- **Codec**: `"vp8"` and `"vp9"` scale better in multi-user calls — prefer these over `"h264"`, which does not scale well beyond small groups. If codecs differ between Web and native clients, Agora's server transcodes transparently (works but adds latency).
- **UID types**: iOS uses `UInt` (unsigned 32-bit), Android uses `Int` (signed 32-bit), Web uses `number`. UIDs > 2,147,483,647 wrap to negative on Android. RTM uses **string UIDs** — use `String(rtcUid)` as a mapping convention.
- **Audio profiles**: Align encoder settings across platforms to avoid one side sending stereo 128kbps while another expects mono. Use `"speech_standard"` (Web) / `AUDIO_PROFILE_DEFAULT` (native) for voice calls.
- **Orientation**: Mobile uses adaptive orientation (rotates with device). Web cameras are typically landscape. Handle aspect ratio changes on the viewer side.
- **Dual stream**: Enable on all platforms for large calls, not just Web.
