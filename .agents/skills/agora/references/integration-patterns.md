# Multi-Product Integration Patterns

This file covers how RTC, RTM, and Conversational AI work together. For SDK-specific code, follow the Level 2 fetch links in each product's reference file.

## When to Use Multiple Products

| Scenario | Products |
|---|---|
| Video/voice call only | RTC only |
| Video call + chat or presence | RTC + RTM |
| AI agent in a call | RTC + ConvoAI REST API (server-side) |
| AI agent + live transcripts or state | RTC + RTM + ConvoAI REST API |
| Text-only signaling (no media) | RTM only |

## RTC + RTM Together

### Initialization Order

Always initialize both SDKs independently — they share no initialization path.

RTC UID and RTM user ID do **not** need to match. Using a shared identity is a coordination convention, not a platform requirement. The right initialization order depends on which identity strategy your app uses.

#### Default pattern — auto-assigned RTC UID

Use this when the RTC client joins with `uid: 0` / `null` and the SDK assigns the final RTC UID:

1. Create and initialize the RTC engine/client
2. Join the RTC channel
3. Read the assigned RTC UID from the join callback / resolved promise
4. Create or log in to the RTM client with `String(rtcUid)`
5. Subscribe to the RTM channel

This is the safest default because it avoids guessing the RTM identity before the RTC UID is known.

#### Advanced pattern — app-level stable identity

Use this when your app already has a stable user identity independent of the RTC UID:

1. Create and initialize the RTC engine/client
2. Create and log in to the RTM client with your app-level user identity
3. Subscribe to the RTM channel
4. Join the RTC channel

This pattern is useful when you want signaling, presence, or pre-call state to arrive before media starts. It requires an explicit RTC↔RTM mapping in your app or backend.

### UID Strategy

RTC and RTM use different UID types:

| SDK | Platform | UID type |
|---|---|---|
| RTC | Web | `number` |
| RTC | iOS | `UInt` (unsigned 32-bit) |
| RTC | Android | `Int` (signed 32-bit) |
| RTM | All platforms | `String` |

Recommended default: use `String(rtcUid)` as the RTM `userId` when your RTC UID is auto-assigned and you want a simple 1:1 mapping between the two systems.

Alternative: use a stable app-level string identity for RTM and maintain an explicit mapping from RTC UID → RTM user ID in your app/backend.

The RTM token subject and RTM login `userId` must match exactly. If your server minted the RTM token for `String(rtcUid)`, the client must log in RTM with that same string — not a different random or app-generated identity.

UIDs greater than 2,147,483,647 wrap to negative on Android RTC — avoid them if Android clients are present.

### Channel Name Convention

Use the **same channel name** for both RTC and RTM. The RTM channel is the coordination layer for the RTC session — same name makes routing unambiguous and is required by the ConvoAI toolkit.

### Token Matrix

Both SDKs require separate tokens in production. Generate them independently on your server:

| Token | Scope | Renew on |
|---|---|---|
| RTC token | `appId` + `channelName` + `uid` | `token-privilege-will-expire` / `onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` |
| RTM token | `appId` + `userId` | RTM connection state `TOKEN_EXPIRED` or equivalent |

See [server/tokens.md](server/tokens.md) for token generation details.

For Level 2 fetch: fetch `https://docs.agora.io/llms.txt`, find the token management guide for your platform, then fetch it.

## RTC + RTM + ConvoAI

Before wiring ConvoAI into an existing multi-product app, read [conversational-ai/architecture.md](conversational-ai/architecture.md) for the end-to-end call sequence, then use the official quickstart as the source of truth for code shape and commands. For existing-app work, use [conversational-ai/integration-from-quickstart.md](conversational-ai/integration-from-quickstart.md) after the quickstart source is inspected; runtime proof is required before claiming the integrated flow works.

### How the Products Connect

```text
Client                          Server
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RTC Engine/Client ──── media ────► Agora RTC
RTM Client ────── messages ──────► Agora RTM
                                      │
                              [ConvoAI agent joins
                               same RTC channel,
                               publishes transcripts
                               and state to same
                               RTM channel]
                                      ▲
App Server ── REST POST /join ──────► Agora ConvoAI API
```

### Initialization Order for ConvoAI

1. Initialize RTC (but do not join the channel yet)
2. Initialize RTM and log in
3. Subscribe to the RTM channel (to receive agent events)
4. Call ConvoAI REST `POST /join` from your **app server** with `channelName`, `uid` (your user's RTC uid), and the RTM flags (see below)
5. Join the RTC channel — the agent will already be there or will join shortly

If your client uses auto-assigned RTC UIDs, adapt the order slightly:

1. Initialize RTC
2. Join RTC and wait for the assigned user UID
3. Log in to RTM with `String(rtcUid)` and subscribe to the RTM channel
4. Call `POST /join` from your app server

The agent can publish transcripts/state through RTM only after the RTM client is logged in and subscribed.

If RTM was just enabled on the project, allow bounded wait/retry before treating an RTM startup failure as a persistent project misconfiguration. Control-plane state can update before the RTM runtime path is actually usable.

### Required ConvoAI Flags for RTM Delivery

When calling `POST /join`, include both of these in the request body:

```json
{
  "advanced_features": {
    "enable_rtm": true
  },
  "parameters": {
    "data_channel": "rtm"
  }
}
```

Both flags are required. Omitting either one means the agent publishes transcripts via RTC data channel instead of RTM, and RTM message events will not fire.

### RTM Channel Name = RTC Channel Name

The ConvoAI agent joins the RTM channel with the **same name** as the RTC channel it joined. When handling `onMessageEvent` / `didReceiveMessageEvent`, filter by `channelName` matching your RTC channel if you are subscribed to multiple channels.

### Agent Events via RTM

The agent publishes JSON messages to the RTM channel. Parse `event.message.data` (Android) or `event.message.stringData` (iOS) as JSON. The `customType` field indicates the event type (transcript, interruption, state change, etc.).

For the full event schema and `customType` values, use Level 2 fetch: fetch `https://docs.agora.io/llms.txt`, locate the Conversational AI event reference, then fetch it.

### Token Matrix for ConvoAI

ConvoAI sessions require three separate tokens:

| Token | Purpose | Who generates |
|---|---|---|
| RTC token (user) | User joins RTC channel | Your app server |
| RTM token (user) | User logs into RTM | Your app server |
| RTC token (agent) | ConvoAI agent joins RTC | Your app server, passed in POST /join |

See [conversational-ai/auth-flow.md](conversational-ai/auth-flow.md) for the full three-token flow (REST API implementors) or [conversational-ai/README.md](conversational-ai/README.md) for SDK-based flows.

## Codec Selection for Mixed Platforms

When Web clients share a channel with iOS or Android native clients:

- Web defaults to `codec: 'vp8'` — this scales well for multi-user calls and is the recommended choice
- `'vp9'` is also a good option with better compression
- `'h264'` does not scale well beyond small groups — avoid it for multi-user scenarios
- If codecs differ between Web and native clients, Agora transcodes server-side — this works but adds latency and is billed separately

See [rtc/cross-platform-coordination.md](rtc/cross-platform-coordination.md) for full cross-platform interop notes.

## Cleanup Order

Reverse of initialization:

1. Leave the RTC channel
2. Unsubscribe from RTM channels
3. Log out of RTM
4. Release both engines/clients

For ConvoAI: call `DELETE /leave` (or the SDK equivalent) from your app server before leaving the RTC channel, to give the agent time to exit gracefully.
