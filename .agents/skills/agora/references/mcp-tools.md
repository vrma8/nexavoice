# Agora Docs MCP Server

<!-- applies-from: v0.2.0 -->

The Agora Docs MCP server (`agora-docs-mcp`) gives AI assistants direct tool-call access to Agora documentation. It is an
optional enhancement — the skill works without it using the two-tier fetch
approach in [doc-fetching.md](doc-fetching.md).

Agora Docs MCP is for traversing docs only. It does not operate Agora backends,
log in to accounts, create projects, write env files, or check project readiness;
the local `agora` CLI handles those workflows.

**Only use MCP when the user explicitly asks for it.** The default documentation
lookup is the two-tier fetch approach in [doc-fetching.md](doc-fetching.md) — use
that regardless of whether MCP is installed.

**MCP endpoint:** `https://mcp.agora.io`

## Tools

| Tool | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `get-doc-content` | `{"uri": "docs://..."}` | Full markdown content |
| `search-docs` | `{"query": "keyword"}` | List of matching doc URIs |
| `list-docs` | `{"category": "...", "limit": 20}` | All docs in a category |

Use `search-docs` when the topic is known but the URI isn't. Use `get-doc-content`
directly when the URI is known.

## Installation

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add agora-docs-mcp --transport http https://mcp.agora.io
```

**Cursor / Windsurf / other MCP-compatible tools:** Add `https://mcp.agora.io` as
an HTTP MCP server in your tool's MCP settings. See your tool's documentation for
the exact configuration format.

## Usage Note

After fetching quick-start docs via MCP, use the content for API structure and field
names only. Do NOT copy sample code verbatim — quick-start examples typically hardcode
credentials and omit production requirements. Apply the gotchas and generation rules
in `references/conversational-ai/README.md` to any generated code.
